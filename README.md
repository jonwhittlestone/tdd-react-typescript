Create failing test for starting at zero, toHaveTextContent() and make it pass for completing implementation.

TODO. Counter state as well as props to be modeled with a type definition

TODO. How to get type safety from state that's readonly? Specify the initial state as not being assignable with `Readonly` and the `readonly` attribute. So if we try to assign to a readonly value, we can get the editor to give us a compile error.

TODO. To allow parent component to specify a different starting count value, and can pass in as a prop. So add in as optional `start?: number`

TODO. get tests to pass with a lifecycle method in implementation `ComponentDidMount`
